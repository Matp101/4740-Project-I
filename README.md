# 4740-Project-I

## First Project

- Form a group of 2 or 3 (3 or 4 for 4740) students.
- Implement a simple DNN architecture (not using pre-existing complete network architecture but you can use pre-existing implementation of layers, loss functions, backpropagation…).
- Choose a dataset from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) with at least 5000 instances and 20 attributes for classification or regression.
- Compare the effect on accuracy of the different learning and optimization techniques (and their hyperparameters) seen in class, like optimizer, dropout, batch normalization, regularization…
- Write a short report (5-6 pages / 4-5 pages) explaining your implementation and showing your experimentations and results. 

You should also provide the Python codes you developed for this project.
